# RoguEngine (aka RE, Rogu, RoguE)

A free game engine for roguelike games (that possibly will be used only in one game)
Work in progress, there are a lot of things to do

Current goal - Inventory and Stacks

This project uses Python 3.10.9, I'm not sure it will work on earlier versions

## The Engine's Structure

The engine will include 4 parts:

* Logic Core aka "Leviathan" - reLogicCore
* Graphic Core aka "Gelios" (maybe) - reGraphicCore (will be added later)
* Sound Core
* Network Core

## TODO (current priority)

* Skills and Skill Tree
* Skills' effects, incl. buffs and debuffs
* Effects' influence
* Item system
* Inventory and equipment system
* Character classes when creating player
* Weapon limits for classes, skills etc.
* Skillset for a weapon
* Classes of Player, Enemy, Boss, NPC and Merchant

## Versioning rules

Current version - indev

If you want to branch off this project, you need to follow these versioning rules:

* If your branch is a copy (without renaming, modification for personal purposes only) then version must be like that "v. current_project_version.branch_commit.your_version>"
* If your branch is supposed to be an independent project then you are free to version however you want, but the credit to this project is necessary

## Vacant positions

I need:

* Docwriters (I'm bad at documenting)

## Pull request rules

If the pull request implements the goals of the project I will accept that but be ready I may rename any classes, variables, methods etc. if I consider it is necessary
