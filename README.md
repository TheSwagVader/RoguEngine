# RoguEngine (aka RE, Rogu, RoguE)

A free game engine for roguelike games (that possibly will be used only in one game)
Work in progress, there are a lot of things to do

## The Engine's Structure

The engine will include 4 parts:

* Logic Core aka "Leviathan" - reLogicCore
* Graphic Core aka "Gelios" (maybe) - reGraphicCore (will be added later)
* Sound Core
* Network Core

## TODO (current priority)

* Skills and Skill Tree
* Skills' effects, incl. buffs and debuffs
* Effects' influence
* Item system
* Inventory and equipment system
* Character classes when creating player
* Weapon limits for classes, skills etc.
* Skillset for a weapon
* Classes of Player, Enemy, Boss, NPC and Merchant
